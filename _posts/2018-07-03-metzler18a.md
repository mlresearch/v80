abstract: Phase retrieval algorithms have become an important component in many modern
  computational imaging systems. For instance, in the context of ptychography and
  speckle correlation imaging, they enable imaging past the diffraction limit and
  through scattering media, respectively. Unfortunately, traditional phase retrieval
  algorithms struggle in the presence of noise. Progress has been made recently on
  developing more robust algorithms using signal priors, but at the expense of limiting
  the range of supported measurement models (e.g., to Gaussian or coded diffraction
  patterns). In this work we leverage the regularization-by-denoising framework and
  a convolutional neural network denoiser to create prDeep, a new phase retrieval
  algorithm that is both robust and broadly applicable. We test and validate prDeep
  in simulation to demonstrate that it is robust to noise and can handle a variety
  of system models.
