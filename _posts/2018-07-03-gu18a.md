abstract: Asynchronous parallel stochastic gradient optimization has been playing
  a pivotal role to solve large-scale machine learning problems in big data applications.
  Zeroth-order (derivative-free) methods estimate the gradient only by two function
  evaluations, thus have been applied to solve the problems where the explicit gradient
  calculations are computationally expensive or infeasible. Recently, the first asynchronous
  parallel stochastic zeroth-order algorithm (AsySZO) was proposed. However, its convergence
  rate is O(1/SQRT{T}) for the smooth, possibly non-convex learning problems, which
  is significantly slower than O(1/T) the best convergence rate of (asynchronous)
  stochastic gradient algorithm. To fill this gap, in this paper, we first point out
  the fundamental reason leading to the slow convergence rate of AsySZO, and then
  propose a new asynchronous stochastic zerothorder algorithm (AsySZO+). We provide
  a faster convergence rate O(1/bT) (b is the mini-batch size) for AsySZO+ by the
  rigorous theoretical analysis, which is a significant improvement over O(1/SQRT{T}).
  The experimental results on the application of ensemble learning confirm that our
  AsySZO+ has a faster convergence rate than the existing (asynchronous) stochastic
  zeroth-order algorithms.
