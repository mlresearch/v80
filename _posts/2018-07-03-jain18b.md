abstract: We provide the first provably joint differentially private algorithm with
  formal utility guarantees for the problem of user-level privacy-preserving collaborative
  filtering. Our algorithm is based on the Frank-Wolfe method, and it consistently
  estimates the underlying preference matrix as long as the number of users $m$ is
  $\omega(n^{5/4})$, where $n$ is the number of items, and each user provides her
  preference for at least $\sqrt{n}$ randomly selected items. Along the way, we provide
  an optimal differentially private algorithm for singular vector computation, based
  on the celebrated Oja’s method, that provides significant savings in terms of space
  and time while operating on sparse matrices. We also empirically evaluate our algorithm
  on a suite of datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
  private algorithms.
