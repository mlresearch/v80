abstract: We study how to effectively leverage expert feedback to learn sequential
  decision-making policies. We focus on problems with sparse rewards and long time
  horizons, which typically pose significant challenges in reinforcement learning.
  We propose an algorithmic framework, called hierarchical guidance, that leverages
  the hierarchical structure of the underlying problem to integrate different modes
  of expert interaction. Our framework can incorporate different combinations of imitation
  learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) at different levels, leading to dramatic
  reductions in both expert effort and cost of exploration. Using long-horizon benchmarks,
  including Montezuma’s Revenge, we demonstrate that our approach can learn significantly
  faster than hierarchical RL, and be significantly more label-efficient than standard
  IL. We also theoretically analyze labeling cost for certain instantiations of our
  framework.
