abstract: 'We propose to tackle the problem of end-to-end learning for raw waveform
  signals by introducing learnable continuous time-frequency atoms. The derivation
  of these filters is achieved by defining a functional space with a given smoothness
  order and boundary conditions. From this space, we derive the parametric analytical
  filters. Their differentiability property allows gradient-based optimization. As
  such, one can utilize any Deep Neural Network (DNN) with these filters. This enables
  us to tackle in a front-end fashion a large scale bird detection task based on the
  freefield1010 dataset known to contain key challenges, such as the dimensionality
  of the inputs data ($>100,000$) and the presence of additional noises: multiple
  sources and soundscapes.'
